Current issues:
1. setting up and configuring webpack
Current error: WARNING in configuration
The 'mode' option has not been set, webpack will fallback to 'production' for this value.
Set 'mode' option to 'development' or 'production' to enable defaults for each environment.
You can also set it to 'none' to disable any default behavior. Learn more: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/

ERROR in main
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './src' in '/Users/emilyasaro/Flex-workshops/dealers_choice_pg'

2. Raw text in public/index.js is displaying on localhost:3000 instead of rendering the html. See server.js for main routes

3. I tried setting up RESTful routes, but the indiviual file routes are likely not required/exported correctly.
I thought I followed the same steps as previous workshops and assignments, but so far I only see "Cannot GET /"
